I'll create an outline of all the files we need to modify or create to implement this enhanced card system.
1. Types/Interfaces:

/src/types/cards/
  - cardActions.ts       (new) - Action interfaces
  - cardProps.ts        (new) - Props interfaces
  - cardState.ts        (new) - State management types
  - index.ts           (new) - Export everything

2. Core Card Components:

/src/components/cards/
  - BaseCard.tsx       (modify) - Enhanced base card
  - CardActions.tsx    (new) - Action buttons component
  - CardHeader.tsx     (new) - Card header with status/badges
  - CardContent.tsx    (new) - Main content area
  - CardFooter.tsx     (new) - Footer with dates/times

3. Specific Card Implementations:

/src/components/cards/
  - ProjectCard/
    - ProjectCard.tsx
    - ProjectCardActions.tsx
    - ProjectCardStats.tsx
  - TaskCard/
    - TaskCard.tsx
    - TaskCardActions.tsx
    - TaskCardProgress.tsx
  - ObjectiveCard/
    - ObjectiveCard.tsx
    - ObjectiveCardActions.tsx
    - ObjectiveCardProgress.tsx
  - TodoListCard/
    - TodoListCard.tsx
    - TodoListCardActions.tsx
    - TodoListCardStats.tsx

4. Hooks and Utilities:

/src/hooks/cards/
  - useCard.ts         (modify) - Enhanced base hook
  - useProjectCard.ts  (new)
  - useTaskCard.ts     (new)
  - useObjectiveCard.ts (new)
  - useTodoListCard.ts (new)

5. Shared Utils:

/src/lib/utils/cards/
  - cardStyles.ts      (new) - Shared styling utilities
  - cardFormatters.ts  (new) - Date/time formatting
  - cardValidators.ts  (new) - Validation helpers

Implementation Order:
1. First implement all types/interfaces
2. Then build core components
3. Create shared utilities and hooks
4. Implement each specific card type one at a time
5. Update any existing components that use cards
Each file can be implemented independently and then brought together. Would you like me to start with any particular file or section? I can provide the full implementation for any of these files in the next message.
Also, since you mentioned starting fresh chats for each file - here's a good breakdown of separate chats you might want to create:
1. Chat 1: Types/Interfaces implementation
2. Chat 2: Core Card Components
3. Chat 3: Project Card Implementation
4. Chat 4: Task Card Implementation
5. Chat 5: Objective Card Implementation
6. Chat 6: TodoList Card Implementation
7. Chat 7: Hooks and Utilities
8. Chat 8: Final Integration
Each chat can focus on its specific area and build upon the previously implemented pieces. Would you like me to provide the detailed code for any of these sections?

please do /src/types/cards/cardActions.ts
